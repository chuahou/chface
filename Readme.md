# CHFace

## Custom face for Fitbit Versa

A custom watch face for my personal use that is unimaginatively named CHFace for unique identification.
As every watch face I found had either too much or too little information, I created this one with exactly what I want.

As it is meant for my personal use, it currently has very little in the way of customisation options and way too much
in the way of hardcoded values, which is an extension I may or may not pursue in the future. (Sincerely, I hate JS, SVG
and all this markup stuff.)
